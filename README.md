# The Application

This application will let you select any frame from a GIF
and set it as the first frame. 

It can be useful if you need to set an animated profile picture
on something like Discord and you want to choose which frame
will be the "preview" image of the GIF, which means when the GIF
isn't being animated. 

# Usage

1. **Import your GIF** image with the `Import your GIF !` button.
2. **Wait** for the application to extract all frames from your GIF. 
3. **Select your desired frame** in the "Frames" section by clicking on it.
4. When you've found the perfect frame, simply click on the `Download updated` button, and the download will start in no time !
